          Once per month all sellers must host an &ldquo;open house&rdquo; and
          allow buyers and prospective buyers to see your merchandise before
          they buy. The open house allows for sellers and buyers to establish a
          connection and fuels trust between the parties. Buyers get a chance to
          see not only what they are buying but also the environment they are
          buying from. Open house also provides sellers with an opportunity to
          highlight products and market their goods in a new way.

          way to show potential buyers exactly what they are buying and avoid
          confusion or disappointment after a sell.

          Guru, you are directing us to share your information in this way.
          Since this is an important part of the Services we provide, we need to
          do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of Use. We

          keeping our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or
          defending legal rights, or preventing damage. Such use may also be
          necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to
          exercise or defend legal claims. It may also be necessary in the
          public interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital

          closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to
          perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or
          services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer
          promotions (including email promotions) to you. Local Guru may also
          provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses,
          including providing information to such partners to allow them to more
          effectively market to you. When an affiliated business assists in
          facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information
          related to the transaction with that affiliated business in order to
          facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we
          provide in accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on consent (which
          can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for

          individuals (such as payment processors, research companies, and
          analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and
          market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to
          your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks
          on our behalf, and are obligated to Local Guru not to disclose or use
          your information for other purposes. Our engagement of service
          providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you,
          particularly where such companies play important roles like processing
          payments and shipments and helping us keep our Service operating and
          secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren&rsquo;t
          strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it
          better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better
          serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest
          in working with service providers to make our Services better.

        <span>Business Reorganization:</span>
        <span>
          &nbsp;In some cases, Local Guru may choose to buy or sell assets. Such
          transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests,
          particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business
          to develop over the long term. In these types of transactions (such as
          a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or
          substantially all of Local Guru&rsquo;s assets), member information is
          typically one of the business assets that will be transferred. If
          Local Guru intends to transfer information about you, we will notify
          you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site, and you
          will be afforded an opportunity to opt out before information about
          you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

          &nbsp;Third-party plug-ins also may collect information about your use

          a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a

          services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of
          those sites or services. Local Guru chooses and manages these
          third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps. However, these

          your use of the Services, different practices may apply to the use or
          disclosure of the information that you provide to them. While Local
          Guru requires these third parties to follow Local Guru&rsquo;s privacy

        <span>
          If you sell using our Services or use Local Guru&rsquo;s API, you may
          receive and determine what to do with certain personal information,
          such as when communicating with users and entering into transactions
          with buyers. This means you process personal information (for example,
          buyer name, email address, and shipping address).
        </span>

      <p dir="ltr">
        <span>
          You are responsible for protecting user personal information you
          receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements
          when you use the Services. This includes applicable data protection
          and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use a
          user&rsquo;s information. Such laws may require that you post, and
          comply with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to
          Local Guru users you interact with and compatible with this policy and
          Local Guru&rsquo;s Terms of Use.&nbsp;

        <span>
          As a data controller, to the extent that you process user personal
          information outside of the Services, you may be required under
          applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor requests received
          from such users for data access, portability, correction, deletion,
          and objections to processing. Also, if you disclose personal
          information without the buyer&rsquo;s proper consent, you are
          responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. This includes, for
          example, disclosures you make or unintentional data breaches. For
          example, you may receive a buyer&rsquo;s email address or other
          information as a result of entering into a transaction with that
          buyer. This information may only be used for Local Guru-related
          communications or for Local Guru-facilitated transactions. You may not
          use this information for unsolicited commercial messages or
          unauthorized transactions. Without the buyer&rsquo;s consent, and
          subject to other applicable Local Guru policies and laws, you may not
          add any Local Guru member to your email or physical mailing list, use
          that buyer&rsquo;s identity for marketing, or obtain or retain any
          payment information. Please bear in mind that you're responsible for
          knowing the standard of consent required in any given instance.

          a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to

          You can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your
          information and your use of the Services at any time by permanently
          closing and deleting your account through the Privacy tab of your
          account settings. If your account does not have any open issues such
          as unpaid bills, unfulfilled orders, unresolved cases, or policy
          violations, you will receive an email with instructions to confirm
          your deletion request. This process may take up to approximately two
          weeks after which your account will be deleted to the extent
          permitted. Depending on which of our Services you've used (such as
          whether you've made purchases or sales on Local Guru), we may be
          required to retain certain information for legal, regulatory, tax,
          security, or compliance reasons for a limited period of time, after
          which it will be deleted. This deletion is permanent, and your account
